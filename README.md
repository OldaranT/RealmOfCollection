Description of the game.
The hunter(Red donut) is on his big missions to explore the world and he must light all the torches in the world. So when ever he is doing his quest to explore to a point or wandering around. When ever he sees a torch he must light it. Because of his urge to light all this torches the all the imps of the land are afraid of him so when ever he comes close the imps will hide from him.

Note:
Because we generate all our objects randomly there is a possibility that the hunter gets stuck in an object. You might need to restart the game if the hunter does not unstuck himself with collision behaviour.
